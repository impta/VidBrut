cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed

software for all its users.
The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to

to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
